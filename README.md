## Tips

[**How to install a plugin**](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157) : a guide by @techAPJ<br><br>

The `[floatr][/floatr]` bbcode has been created but I didn't add a button, it doesn't feel necessary.<br><br>

If you want to change the margin in the float left, you can go to the Customize section in your admin panels, create a new css page and add this and change the value in the margin part : 

`.floatl {
float:left;
margin-right:15px;
}`


`.floatr {
float:right;
margin-left:15px;
}`
