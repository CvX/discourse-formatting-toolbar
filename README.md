## Tips

- The [floatr][/floatr] bbcode has been created but I didn't add a button, it doesn't feel necessary.

- If you want to change the margin in the float left, you can go to the Customize section in your admin panels, create a new css page and add this and change the value in the margin part : 

.floatl {<br>
float:left;<br>
margin-right:15px;<br>
}


.floatr {<br>
float:right;<br>
margin-left:15px;<br>
}
